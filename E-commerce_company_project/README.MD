## SelectWords.py
###### Background of the project: 
  This is an automated promotion project. 
  We need to determine the keywords for the next purchase based on the effects we have previously spent on different keywords on the online shopping platform.

  Finally, the prediction results of the model with the lowest MSE and the highest R2 are selected as the most likely performance of the keyword in the future.
##### Code usageï¼š
  Use simple multiple models to make basic predictions on the future performance of keywords and provide effective keyword pools for the promotion department.

## Return_Order_FollowUp.sql
##### Backbround of the project:
  E-commerce merchants want to know the follow-ups of the return order.

  MySQL script, used to query the four tables (return order table, all order table, product table, order product table) by using join.
